## Squarespace 7.1 quirks
- Code injection order:
  - Site Styles (theme) → Custom CSS → Code Injection (header/footer) → Page header code.
  - Prefer site/global scope for editor iframe coverage.
- Fluid Engine (FE) behaviors:
  - Saves breakpoint-specific grid spans and row templates causing tall sections.
  - "Fill Screen" can force viewport-height sections; disable globally via CSS if needed.
  - FE block shells often have height: 100% inline; reset to height: auto and min-height: 0.
- Gallery block quirks:
  - .sqs-block-gallery may reserve extra height; ensure height: auto; min-height: 0.
  - Slides nested via .sqs-gallery-container → .sqs-gallery.sqs-gallery-design-grid → .slide .margin-wrapper.
  - Bottom gaps appear when sticky siblings reserve flow space; avoid by disabling stickiness or removing from flow on mobile.
- Sticky elements:
  - .fe-block.sqs-position-sticky may expand section height when scrolled past gallery.
  - On mobile, labels can end at bottom or duplicate-like; disable sticky/hide on narrow widths.
- Known mobile/layout bugs to watch:
  - Duplicate gallery on narrow viewports when compositing reset not scoped to tabs container.
  - Bottom gap under gallery due to FE's row grid/Fill Screen or sticky blocks.
  - Footer translation too early at some widths (fixed in editor; keep regression watch).
- Test pages/URLs:
  - Editor: <!-- TODO: clarify test page slugs -->
